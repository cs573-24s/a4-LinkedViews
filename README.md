Project description: This project was a continued investigation into the Penglings dataset, as well as an investigation into all the different chart types in d3.js. I investigated how the data would change every year, looking at a lot of different variable types in the penglings dataset.

Technical achievements: It took a considerable amount of effort figuring out how to create all these display types and label them, as well as connecting them all to a time slider. My achievement is the sheer amount of types of visualizations I created.

Design achievements: I didn't focus on the design for this one, but I researched into how to best dispaly text in visualizations, dealing with things like margins and removing outlines from graphs.
